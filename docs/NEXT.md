# NEXT.md

**The single most underused founder tool. Read this every time you sit down.**

Update this at the END of every work session. Not the start — the end. Future-you walking in cold should know exactly what to do next without thinking.

## NEXT ACTION

**NEXT** (Sprint 1 rescoped around **Method B** — see `docs/method-b-design.md`):
1. **Deploy & observe** — `npx wrangler deploy -c wrangler-story.toml` + secrets, apply `0014_method_b.sql`, set KV `methodb:enabled=1`, then watch `/admin/pipeline` for a few days. Tune the rules pre-filter, delta prompt, and synthesis voice against real output. ← this task
2. Step 3 — Haiku judge in `correlateToTopic` + `branch_of`/`sequel_of` edges (derbi→skandal, hoca krizi) + parallel claim-tracks (rakip-kulüp transfers). *(hold until shadow output observed.)*

**Done:**
- Method B design + diagram (DECISIONS 2026-06-05).
- Shadow worker scaffold — `worker-story-agent.js`, `wrangler-story.toml`, `0014_method_b.sql` (additive). Inert by default.
- Step 2 core — correlate → rules-pre-filter → Haiku delta → Sonnet synthesis-from-facts into shadow pool; cost counted vs shared cap + methodb-only counter; budget-bounded (`SHADOW_SYNTH_CAP`).
- `/admin/pipeline` compare page (legacy vs methodb side-by-side + last-run tally + methodb cost).
- **Cutover seam** — `getServedArticles` blue/green resolver (per-site `pipeline:active` pointer, defaults legacy, cold-start fallback) wired into the `/cache` serving path; `/admin/pipeline/flip` endpoint + flip buttons on the compare page. Instantly reversible, safe-by-default. 72/72 tests green.
- Laptop-free reconcile: **P0.3** (byline+date) and **P2.1** (sitemap exclusions) were already live; P2.1 also now drops thin `copy_source`.

**Done / descoped:**
- Task 1.1 — Docs reconciliation (ROADMAP/NEXT/DECISIONS). ✅ commit `0f64196`
- Task 1.2 — Per-source-per-content-type NVS+lifetime config. ❌ **descoped 2026-06-03** — tier multiplier + per-type half-life already cover it. See DECISIONS.md 2026-06-03.
- Task 1.3 — Narrow re-score-after-extraction. ↗ **superseded 2026-06-05** by Method B (the re-score is subsumed by scoring-as-triage in the new pipeline). See DECISIONS.md 2026-06-05.

## Recent sessions summary (2026-05-29 – 2026-06-03)

- **NVS Harmonization P0–P14 complete.** Scoring config-driven (`SCORING_CONFIG_DEFAULTS`, `loadSiteConfig`, `getEffectiveNVS`, `computeScore`); video rail wired (`rail_fallback`); homepage video cap (max 3); curated video NVS override (belgeseller/unutulmaz → NVS 15); push-to-homepage toggle (`push_to_homepage`, `manual_nvs`, `manual_half_life`, `push_enabled_at`); config admin Phase 1+2 live; dedup hardened (within-batch + Duhuliye T3→T4). Full decision log: DECISIONS.md entries from 2026-05-30 onward.
- **Cost infrastructure complete.** `addUsagePhase()` on all call sites; `/admin/financials` breakdown UI; prompt caching (`cache_control: ephemeral`, `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31`). Commits: `9c09a66`, `4c85d19`.
- **Source facts table.** `source_facts` table created in Supabase. Every pipeline run now stores raw transcript/RSS content for future re-distillation (`src/utils.js:202`, called at `worker-fetch-agent.js:5032`). RSS facts saved from `publishable` array, not `savedWithIds` (fire-and-forget, never blocks pipeline). Commits: `ed5c96a`, `8606867`.
- **Per-video synthesis.** `generateVideoSynthesis` (`src/publisher.js:3122`) replaces channel-specific `generateRabonaDigest`. All three treatments working: `embed` (Haiku intro + iframe), `synthesize` (transcript → article, no iframe), `embed_and_synthesize` (article + iframe at bottom, falls back to embed-only if no transcript). Commit: `2189ded`.

## RULES

- One next action. Not three. Not "various things."
- Concrete, not abstract. Bad: "work on Facts Firewall." Good: "Add migration for `fact_lineage` table in `migrations/0042_fact_lineage.sql`."
- If you finish a session without knowing the next action, the session wasn't really done. Take 2 minutes to figure it out before closing the laptop.
- The PM agent reads this and references it in Friday close messages.
