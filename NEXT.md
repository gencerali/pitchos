## Phase 2 — Bugs & Quick Wins ✅ DONE

- [x] **2.1** Post-cap fallback XP — `cap_fallback_xp` col on `xp_actions`; +1 after daily cap
- [x] **2.2** Reaction XP — `react_article` action (+1, daily_cap=10); `/api/xp/react` endpoint; wired in SPA + Worker article page
- [x] **2.3** Streak bonus — auto-award `streak_5_bonus` (+50) every 5th checkin streak

---

## Phase 3 — Comment & Reaction System

- [x] **3.1** Fix comments not showing in SPA article view (`renderArticleView`)
- [x] **3.2** Slug-based keying — `article_comments` + `article_reactions` now use `article_slug` + `user_id`; no guest commenting (auth required)
- [x] **3.3** Comment XP — wire `/api/xp/comment` on successful submit
- [x] **3.4** Reply threading — `parent_id UUID` on `article_comments`, 1-level indented display
- [x] ~~**3.5** Guest commenting~~ — **cancelled**: require login to comment; guest CTA shown instead
- [x] **3.6** Moderation Layer 1 — client-side Turkish swear word blocklist (~50 terms)
- [ ] **3.7** Moderation Layer 2 — Claude Haiku toxicity check on `/comment` POST
- [ ] **3.8** Emotion reactions — expand `article_reactions.reaction` to 5 values; update SPA UI
- [ ] **3.9** Taraftar Nabzı — `/api/sentiment` aggregation + article sidebar widget

---

## Phase 4 — Tribün / Community Features

- [x] **4.1** Score prediction UI + `/api/xp/predict` wiring — `tribun.html`, `/api/upcoming-match`, 52 tests
- [x] **4.2** Prediction evaluation — `/api/xp/evaluate-predictions` (cron, `X-Internal-Secret` protected, fully tested in Phase 4.1)
- [x] **4.3** Starting 11 lineup guess — `/api/xp/starting-11`, `/api/squad`, UI card in `tribun.html` with duplicate guard + XP, 40 tests
- [x] **4.4** Poll voting — `/api/xp/poll-vote`, `/api/polls`, DB tables (`polls`, `poll_votes`), UI card in `tribun.html` with auth gate + results, 35 tests
- [x] **4.5** Tribün page `/tribun` — full community hub: score prediction + Starting 11 + Poll + community stats section

---

## Phase 5 — Profile & UX Polish

- [ ] **5.1** Profile: XP activity feed (recent `xp_events`)
- [ ] **5.2** Profile: badge grid (earned + locked as goals)
- [ ] **5.3** Profile: prediction history tab
- [ ] **5.4** Level-up notification (modal/banner)
- [ ] **5.5** Badge unlock notification

---

## Phase 6 — Schema Migrations

- [x] `xp_actions`: `cap_fallback_xp integer default 0`
- [x] `xp_actions`: insert `react_article` row
- [x] `article_comments`: add `article_slug`, `user_id`, `site_id`
- [x] `article_comments`: add `parent_id` (reply threading, Phase 3.4)
- [x] `article_reactions`: add `article_slug`, `site_id`
- [ ] `article_reactions`: add `emotion` (5-value reactions, Phase 3.8)
- [ ] `profiles`: add `is_bot boolean default false`

---

## Phase 7 — Pre-Launch

- [ ] Full XP QA pass — test each action, no double-earning
- [ ] Set `XP_TOKEN_SECRET` in Cloudflare Pages env vars (not `dev-secret`)
- [ ] Bot seeding — after Phase 3+4 stable; 1500 synthetic users + weekly cron engine
- [ ] Rate limiting on `/react` and `/comment`

---

## Known Failing Tests

None. All 338 tests passing as of Phase 4 completion.

The 5 pre-existing failures in `gamification-xp-engine.test.js` were fixed during Phase 4 work by updating `enqueueTail` and `setupForBadge` to enqueue the correct number of `user_badges` existence-check responses for every badge threshold crossed.
